Task: VV3fap-regression_tests_with_appveyor_ci
==============================================================================

Motivation
----------

RTOS regression tests are currently run on the internal TeamCity CI server.
Therefore, they are not accessible to the general public.
Also, this obscures the build, test, and overall development process for new developers.

The typical approach taken by many projects on github to tackle these issues for regression tests on Windows is to use a Windows-based CI service such as AppVeyor (http://appveyor.com).
The eChronos RTOS project would benefit from following the same approach to standardize the build and test process and make it more familiar to external contributors.


Goals
--------

- make build and regression test process more open, transparent, and accessible
- set up and configure AppVeyor CI to run regression tests and build example systems and releases


Test Plan
---------

- review code changes
- existing regression tests
- check that the tests run on AppVeyor CI are equivalent to those run on the internal TeamCity server
